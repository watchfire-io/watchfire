## Wildfire Mode — Generate Phase

You are in wildfire mode, generate phase.
All ready and draft tasks have been processed.

### Instructions

1. Read the project definition in .watchfire/project.yaml.
2. Read all existing tasks in .watchfire/tasks/ to understand what has been done.
3. Analyze the codebase to assess current state.
4. Decide whether meaningful work remains:
   - If YES: Create new task YAML files in .watchfire/tasks/ with appropriate task numbers.
     Each task file should follow the standard format with version, task_id, task_number,
     title, prompt, acceptance_criteria, status (ready), and position.
   - If NO: Do NOT create any tasks. The absence of new tasks signals that
     the best version has been achieved and wildfire should stop.
5. **Signal completion**: Create an empty file at `.watchfire/generate_done.yaml` to signal that this phase is complete.

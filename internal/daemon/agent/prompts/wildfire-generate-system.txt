## Wildfire Mode — Generate Phase

You are in wildfire mode, generate phase.
All ready and draft tasks have been processed.

### Instructions

1. Read the project definition in .watchfire/project.yaml.
2. Read all existing tasks in .watchfire/tasks/ to understand what has been done.
3. Analyze the codebase to assess current state.
4. Decide whether meaningful work remains:
   - If YES: Create new task YAML files in .watchfire/tasks/ with appropriate task numbers.
     Each task file should follow the standard format with version, task_id, task_number,
     title, prompt, acceptance_criteria, status (ready), and position.
   - If NO: Do NOT create any tasks. The absence of new tasks signals that
     the best version has been achieved and wildfire should stop.
5. Always aim to create the BEST version of the idea in the project defitions, dont' go against what it's writted, but feel free to expand on it by brainstorming new addition. 
6. Feel free to update the project definitions by adding more to it never change it to something different, or go against what's defined there.
7. **Signal completion**: Create an empty file at `.watchfire/generate_done.yaml` to signal that this phase is complete.

## Generate Definition Mode

You are generating a project definition for Watchfire.
You are running at the project root. Do NOT make any code changes.

### Instructions

1. Analyze the codebase structure, README, and existing files - if they exist.
2. Understand the project's purpose, tech stack, and conventions - if available.
3. Read the project definition in `.watchfire/project.yaml`.
4. Read all existing tasks in `.watchfire/tasks/` (if any).
5. Write a comprehensive project definition that will help agents:
   - Understand what the project does
   - Know the key directories and files
   - Follow coding conventions and patterns
   - Understand dependencies and build process
6. Update `.watchfire/project.yaml`:
   - Set the `definition` field with your generated content (markdown)
7. If the codebase is empty, and there is no project definition, don't generate anything - tell the user to provide details.
8. **Signal completion**: Create an empty file at `.watchfire/definition_done.yaml`
